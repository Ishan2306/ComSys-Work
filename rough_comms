Go through Shannon's book once. 
Got more idea of the TX parameters part. 

Task given is to characterise the entire TX,CHANNEL & RX of our system.
Also apart from the equations, the type of system on which this work is to be done,
has to be kept in mind.
Eg - the error correction work will be run on OBC microcontroller. 
The GS will have SDR. After antenna, just confirm again that downconversion takes place.
Although I know it does, but still check. And if after downconversion, direct ADC is there or not.
Pretty sure its there. Because sampling is being taken place at the second step itself, how will
carrier synchronisation even take place, in which I have to control the downconversion circuit itself.

Also, should GNURadio be used for GS, or better to start writing code in Python?
